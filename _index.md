The Yext command line tool (Yext CLI) is the means for configuring and developing against your Yext account from your local machine. Using the Yext CLI you can:

* Edit your Yext Account configuration from your local machine 
* Clone configuration from one Yext Account to another Yext Account 
* Save a version of your account configuration as a backup to revert to when making big changes

And much more!
