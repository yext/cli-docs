## Install on Mac

**Install using Homebrew**

If you are using Mac, you can install the Yext CLI using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you donâ€™t already have Homebrew installed, follow the installation instructions on the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) site first. Then, you can run the following command to install the Yext CLI on your machine: 

```cli
brew install yext/tap/yext
```


If the Yext CLI is already installed, you can upgrade your version with the following command:

```cli
brew upgrade yext
```

\

**Debugging on a Mac**

If you run into problems installing or running the CLI, look through the following debugging steps:

1. Make sure which yext outputs /usr/local/bin/yext. If not, run the following command and then open up a new bash shell before running the CLI again.
        
    ```cli
    rm -f <output of "which yext"> 
    ```

2. Make sure there is no alias for yext with alias yext.
    
3. Run brew untap yext/tap and then brew install yext/tap/yext.

## Enable Autocompletion (bash/zsh/powershell only)

Enabling autocompletion in the CLI will allow you to partially type a command and then press the `tab` key to fill in the rest of the command. If you installed the Yext CLI using brew, this should happen automatically. 

To enable autocompletion for the Yext CLI, follow the instructions generated by  $ yext completion --help or the instructions found in our CLI reference for yext [completion](https://hitchhikers.yext.com/docs/cli/universal-command-group/completion/).
